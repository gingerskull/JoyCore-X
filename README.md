# JoyCore-X

A modern configuration dashboard for JoyCore-FW controllers, built with Tauri, React, and Rust.

## üöß Work in Progress

This project is currently being migrated from the [original Qt6/C++ implementation](https://github.com/gingerskull/JoyCore-X) to a modern Tauri-based application. Core functionality is implemented but hardware testing is pending.

## Overview

JoyCore-X provides a desktop application for configuring RP2040-based HOTAS controllers via USB serial communication. Configure axes, buttons, and profiles through an intuitive interface.
## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri 2.0 for native integration and serial communication
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Device Communication**: USB Serial (CDC) @ 115200 baud
- **Target Hardware**: RP2040-based controllers (VID: 0x2E8A, PID: 0xA02F)

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Tauri backend with serial communication
- ‚úÖ React frontend with modern UI components
- ‚úÖ Device discovery and connection management
- ‚úÖ Configuration interfaces (axes, buttons, profiles)
- üîÑ Hardware testing pending
- ‚è≥ Advanced features in development

## Unified Serial Architecture (Overview)

The legacy dual-path serial code has been fully removed in favor of a single unified asynchronous command + event pipeline:

- A background reader task parses every inbound line once.
- Lines are classified as either command response buffer lines or real-time event/monitor lines (GPIO/MATRIX/SHIFT/etc.).
- High‚Äëlevel operations build a `CommandSpec` (name, matcher, timeout, optional min-duration) and dispatch it through a `UnifiedSerialHandle`.
- A `ResponseMatcher` (Contains / UntilPrefix / FixedLines / Custom) determines completion. Metrics (latency, success/failure counts) are collected per command name.
- Real‚Äëtime hardware state updates are broadcast on an event channel for UI consumers to snapshot without blocking command flow.

Benefits:
1. Single source of truth for serial parsing (no duplicated readers)
2. Deterministic matching + timeout handling
3. Built‚Äëin latency instrumentation for future tuning
4. Clean separation between request/response flows and streaming hardware telemetry

Key Types (Rust backend):
- `UnifiedSerialBuilder` ‚Äì constructs the background task + handle
- `UnifiedSerialHandle` ‚Äì API surface (send_command, get snapshots, metrics)
- `CommandSpec` / `ResponseMatcher` ‚Äì declarative response completion

All prior feature flags (e.g. `unified-serial`) were removed; the unified path is always active.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
